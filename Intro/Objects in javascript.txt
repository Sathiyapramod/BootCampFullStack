Objects in Javascript:

* Objects in Javascript are distinct and collection of unordered data in the form of Key & Value pairs.
* JS objects has properties associated with it in order to define its characteristics.
* One can access the properties of an object using bracket.

Syntax for declaring a Simple object in Javascript is as follows:

    var Objectname = { key1: "Value1", Key2:"value2", Key3:"value3", ..... KeyN: "ValueN" }

Example:

    var Student = { name: "Sathiya", City: "Chennai", Year: "2022"};

Here Name , City, Year are the all "keys" and their corresponding answers are all "Values:.


Below mentioned are the few major takeaways from Objects in Javascript:


(1) Objects are called only be reference, not by value.
Below Example suits well for the explanation:

const person = {
  firstName:"Sathiya",
  lastName:"Pramod",
  age:25, 
  }

const x = person: //Will not create copy of person

const x = person;
x.age = 10;      // Will change both x.age and person.age

 

(2) An object can even be declared as a Value inside a Parent object in Javascript.

E.g. :
var Student = { name: "Sathiya", 
                City: "Chennai",
                Year: "2022"
                Details: {firstName: "Sathiya", lastName: "Pramod", Age: "25"}};

console.log(Student.name);  // Sathiya
console.log(Student.City);  // Chennai
console.log(Student.Details.Age);  // 25

Here values for the "Details" are themselves given as an object to furnish the further Required data.
