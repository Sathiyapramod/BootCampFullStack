---HTTP1.1------ 

* HTTP1.1 was introduced in 1997. 
* It works on the textual format
* It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
* It compresses data by itself.
* Limitation of HTTP1.1 is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.

---HTTP2-------

* It was introduced in 2015 considering the shortcomings of HTTP1.1 using Google's SPDY protocol.
* it works on the binary protocol.
* It allows multiplexing so that one TCP connection is required for multiple requests from client to server.
* It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
* It uses HPACK for data compression.


The major advantage of HTTP2 is instead of waiting for the client to request for assets (like JS and CSS),
the server can “push” the resources it believes would be required by the client. It Avoids the round trip.
